# Block_Matching-Algorithm-for-Motion-Compensation

By taking into consideration the motion of the camera and/or the objects in the video, motion compensation is a computational algorithmic technique that is used to anticipate a frame in a video given the previous and/or future frames. For example, while creating MPEG-2 files, it is used to encode video data for video compression. By transforming a reference image into the current image, motion compensation explains a picture. The reference image could be from the past, present, or even the future. The compression efficiency can be increased when images from previously transmitted or stored photos can be accurately synthesized.


Block Matching is a method of temporal compression used in video encoding. This technique's main goal is to calculate the distances between each block of pixels in two subsequent frames. The majority of the total time spent on video coding is spent on this method, which is used in the motion estimate step.
